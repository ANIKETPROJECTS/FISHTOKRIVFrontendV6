- **Sitemap:** Not yet generated — should be created for all category and product URLs
- **Robots.txt:** Not yet present — `/admin/` must be disallowed
- **Meta tags:** Currently minimal — need per-page title, description, og:image, og:title, og:description
- **Images:** Products use MongoDB-stored image URLs; fallback is a branded "Image Coming Soon" placeholder
- **Mobile-first:** App is fully responsive / mobile-optimised — good for Core Web Vitals
